A warm afternoon breeze brushed across the palace grounds, carrying the scent of fresh-cut grass to Tuthru’s nose. A pleasant tingle of warmth caressed her body, as the ambient warmth of the early Kaldari dry season. Tuthru took a deep breath and smiled; her belly was full of food, and her balls were heavy and sloshing, a happy combination indeed. She lazily shrugged off her robes and chucked them to one side where a masked servant fumbled to catch them before the garment hit the floor. The only thing covering her body now was a garish array of jewellery, which while it was more than what could be called a tasteful decoration, still left nothing to the imagination. On the contrary, far from hiding her robust curvaceous form, humongous bouncing mammaries and her bloated fat and mutant horsecock, the jewellery framed them and presented her assets even more prominently than had she simply been wearing nothing at all. Of course, while all of this was meant to enhance her image as the goddess of decadence, to those around her, out here in the garden where she could relax and be herself with her beloved wives, it made her feel like god of her own little world…which of course she was.

With Tuthru's discarded robes in hand, the servant began to swiftly dash off to warn the wives of their mistress' imminent arrival, meanwhile Tuthru clasped her hands behind her back and began to stroll at a leisurely pace toward the edge of the courtyard. This was the highest point of the garden, which was contained within a basin of sorts which stretched down the southern face of the hill atop which Tuthru's palace was constructed. This basin offered another layer of isolation (or protection, as Tuthru thought of it) from the outside world for her most treasured posessions, her wives. The courtyard, while being a pleasant area to survey the rest of the garden, was conveniently abutted onto the palace cloisters which offered some shade and shelter. This also made it a convenient area for her to step outside and stretch her legs during short breaks.

The soft crunch of lush green grass underfoot soon gave way to the firm coolness of sandstone slabs that paved the stairway down from her palace into the garden proper. The pleasant burble of running water became gradually louder with each step she descended as the glass-smooth laminar finish of an artificial waterfall cascaded down to form a decorative brook running through the center of her arboretum. The shade of the trees and the soothing spray of water tickling her ankles was exactly what she needed to help her shed the weight of responsibility for her empire. As she strolled alongside the brook she let her mind wander, dreaming of her wives and their flawless bodies, and of all the disgusting things she was going to do to them,..and for that matter all of the disgusting things they were going to do to her! Her member began to throb and stiffen, a thick pulsating network of veins contouring its surface as it began to lazily lift itself up from slapping against her thighs, to swaying about in front of her, precum drooling from its triple-flared head like a leaky tap.

The treeline ended abruptly, marking a perfectly straight line boundary between the arboretum and a new area of the garden. The baking heat of the sun once again beat down on her as an expanse of neatly mowed grass stretched out in front of her, almost a kilometre wide and twice as long. The natural looking stream which she had walked alongside until now, changed even more abruptly than the treeline back into a neat canal lined with azure tiles. Neat walkways framed it on either side, with geometric flowerbeds carefully curated a few feet away, and it ended in a short tumble into a huge decorative lake which Tuthru insisted on referring to as a 'pond'. As the centerpeice of the entire garden, the pond was quite a sight to behold. It featured a complex array of fountains which fired impressive arcs of water from one side to the other, changing their shape and pattern with the time of day and year. Marble statues stood on pedestals, each around 10m from the edge of the pond and depicted an array of mythical figures from scripture and folklore, including Tuthru's five wives on the very highest pedestals depicted in poses of supplication and worship to their goddess. At the center of them all, standing 30ft tall, was a copper-plated statue of Tuthru herself, her polished metallic breasts glistening. Her right hand was held permenantly above her head. Glass sculptures of oversized dice seemed to levitate in her grasp, though in fact they were held there by an intricate armature of thin wires, and they refracted the sunlight into manifold hues of green, blue red and amber. Beneath her left arm, the cornucopia was depicted spilling over with fruit and meat and was plumbed into the fountains, causing it to spew forth a stream of blood-red water meant to represent wine, which trickled down between her dazzling copper-coated boobs. And of course, between her legs she proudly brandished her scepter of divine power. The keys representing the five divine virtues dangled from the statue's immortal erection, gently swaying in the breeze. The statue's lifeless eyes stared down at her with a self-satisfied smirk, and Tuthru mirrored its expression as she rinsed her feet in the canal, and took a seat on a silk-covered plush lounging chair by the side of the pool.

“You might wanna get your makeup re-done love, your eyeliner’s running again.”

With a dismissive wave of the dragoness’ hand, Tanya understood that was her cue to fuck off and not show her face again until it was back to the image of unblemished perfection her goddess expected. She smiled and nodded obediently

“Of course, my love. Apologies for reducing your pleasure with my selfish tears of joy~”

Tuthru giggled happily flashing a playful wink before, clutching Kasia and Phoenecia close to her side. “Whatever, bitch. Just get it fixed, we’ll see about forgiveness when you get back!! You’ll have to…earn it~” the goddess’ dick visibly stiffened in arousal before a cruel smirk crossed her face “In the meantime, I’m in good company, so no need to rush the job. Make sure you’re perfect for me ‘k?”

Tuthru swivelled and turned her back on the raptor, strolling off with her other two wives in her arms.

“Well then, ladies! This sperm ain’t gonna drain itself, why don’t you find me some nice tight cunt to squeeze it out into”

“Of course, my dear~” responded Phoenicia “If it’s tightness you’re in the mood for then I can reccommend Krystal for your enjoyment. Her rump is delightfully shapely and her holes are firm and well built while retaining that pillowy softness I know just brings the nectar flowing effortlessly from your pent-up ramrod!”

Kasia interrupted, a devlish grin on her face, “Not as easily as Arkana’s new cuntsleeve, I crafted it myself to be the ultimate experience for your cock~ But if you prefer a more organic experience, I have a few bimbos freshly dosed up to leak from all their holes and they crave your touch as though it were water on their parched tongues~ In your infinite mercy, you wouldn’t deny them that would you love?”

Tuthru raised her hand, a stone cold expression of frustration on her face. “Ladies…please…spare me the theatrics~ My nuts feel like a pair of running butter-churns and thanks to Tanya’s lovely welcome back there my cock is so hard it physically aches, on top of that it’s a very hot day and so with all that said…I’m not feeling picky. I need pussy, and I need it NOW. So…I’m going to close my eyes and count to ten, and when I open them I expect you to take me to a fully prepped breeding lounge and for my cock to be fed straight into an awaiting cunt. Do I make myself clear?”

She lifted her chin, inquisitively glaring down at the two wives over her nose as they nodded the affirmative. With a satisfied smile, she crossed her hands behind her back, “Wonderful~” With that she straightened her back, head held high as she shut her eyes and slowly began to count. As each number passed slowly but puprosely through her lips, she heard rushed scuttling noises whipping around her as Phoenicia and Kasia departed to take care of her request, and her anticipation grew until it was almost too much to bear. Her dick stood proudly ahead of her, hard as steel as it drooled in anticipation of being crammed into a soft tight space and made to disgorge load after load of hot steamy sperm.

When she reached ten, she opened her eyes with a smile. Kasia stood sheepishly before her, with Phoenicia to her side holding herself tall and proud as ever. She held her arm out, guiding the godess toward a shaded bed a few steps away, a curtain draped over it to reveal a shapely pair of legs spread ready for her arrival.

“If you’d like to come right this way, my love! A pleasure pit is awaiting a deposit at your leisure~” announced Phoenicia with a smile, gently placing a hand in the small of Tuthru’s back.

“Don’t stop walking till you’re as deep as you want to be, Ru~ I’ll take care of any…’alignment’, you just concentrate on enjoying yourself!”

Silently, Tuthru began to walk forward with a smug smirk on her face. Her chest jiggled with each step, wreathed in gold chain and rubies which complimented her elegant feminine form. Similar adornments decorated her throbbing ebony trunk, as though the unwieldy mass of veiny schlongmeat weren’t completely incongruous to her otherwise flawless feminine beauty.

With two hands clasped around the neck of Tuthru’s lubricated log, Kasia guided it precicely toward its target with a gentle downward pressure that meant its owner didn’t even need to break stride as that triple-flared head found its mark between the drooling pussy lips of the whore they had selected to be her meatsink. Tuthru let out a moan of relief as she felt her needy rod slide deep into a warm wet hole. Kasia’s skilled hands stroked the twin knots that throbbed and strained at the base of Tuthr’s cock, as a consolation prize for being last into the soft heavenly warmth that awaited them, but sure enough its turn came as Tuthru’s nuts clapped gently against the thighs of her quarry as the divine shaft finally bottomed out in her.

Tuthru panted in pleasure, taking a few moments to steel herself as she wrapped her hands around the rump set out before her. Phoenicia dutifully got down on her knees, cupping and caressing the goddess’ powerful balls.

With a cruel grin, Tuthru drew back her hips, drawing out a sizeable length of her equine cock before ramming it back in, relishing the incomparable sensation made ever the more viceral by Phoenicia’s hands making sure no part of her divine junk felt left out from the stimulation. Kasia added a little oil to the mix, pouring a healthy dollop and letting it dribble down between the concubine’s glistening buns before being forcibly rammed into the mix by Tuthru’s hard throbbing meat as she began to truly fuck. With Phoenicia taking care of all the downstairs delicacy, Tuthru needed only rock her hips in a deep and steady rhythm and enjoy her rightful treatment as the uncontested she-stud conquerer of cunt.

With a deep grunt of pleasure, Tuthru buried her fleshy fuckstick deep into the nameless whore, gripping the woman’s thighs and pushing her cock as deep as it would go as she finally blew a steamy hot dollop of divine seed into her pussy. Phoenicia tugged and massaged her mistress’ balls as they clenched and retracted to dump their contents, and as shot after shot of thick white cream laboured its way up the goddess’ cock, causing it to bulge and ripple under the pressure of such a thick substance being squirted up her fleshy tube, Phoenicia squeezed on the goddess’ dripping fat cumtanks to drain every last drop she could.

Tuthru just stood and sighed, enjoying the waves of sublime ecstasy that gripped her dick and pulsed throughout her body, wracking her with spasms of climactic bliss that she tried not to show beyond a satisfied smile on her face. Her trembling legs and lazily fluttering eyelids gave her away though, toes curling in pleasure causing her claws to sink into the soft grass beneath her feet. Pump after pump of hot cum gushed rapidly from her cock, each one more satisfying than the last.

Thick rolls of bunched-up ball batter began cascading down in thick white dollops that timed out with Tuthru’s clenching orgasm. A posessive grin spread across Tuthru’s face and she pulled away, her rock-hard fleshy tube making a noisy wet pop as it began spewing its seed all over the smooth round ass-cheeks and dripping down the woman’s thighs. Kasia knew instantly what to do, gripping Tuthru’s meat and rubbing it up and down with both hands. With each firm stroke up and down the meaty member another shot of sperm came gushing forth, buckets of spunk pooling on the floor.

Tuthru politely crossed her hands behind her back and gave out a satisfied sigh, her orgasm hadn’t exactly finished as such, but when did they ever. Her semi-erect member still twitched and drooled with thick strings of mozzarella-like cum that any man would envy even in the throes of a thorough ball-draining. Kasia placed a passionate kiss on Tuthru’s dong, just above her first medial ring, before delving into the inches-thick puddle of cum that had formed around her knees and happily smearing the fresh nut-slurry all over her face and tits, moaning as she rubbed it into her bare breasts.

“Ahh~ Fresh goddess cum, so good for the skin~ Thank you for your gifts, my love!!”

Phoenicia rose back to her feet, maintaining a calm and aloof composure despite being drenched in nut butter from the chest down, and still a little woozy from the intoxicating musk of her goddess’ steamy balls and their contents.

“An impressive discharge my love, I’m so glad to be a connoiseur of cum in a place where such quality is delivered in such gluttonous volumes~ Not to be unexpected from the divine creator, of course, but I would be remiss to take such perfect nectar for granted, especially when your divine mana is my singular delight.”

Tuthru smirked, rubbing out another dollop of thick cum from her long shaft. She turned around, leaving sticky white footprints behind her in the grass, but not before giving Phoenicia a parting gift slinging a handful of hot spunk into her face.

“You’re welcome, you beautiful bitch. Now, follow me, I’m still leaking and need care and attention. You two…” she gestured to Kasia, and the nameless bitch who had opened the curtain and was struggling to get back to her feet after the brutal fucking, “Clean up that fucking mess you made, would ya? And give me a good show while you do it or you’ll find yourself cleaning even more mess up this evening~”
