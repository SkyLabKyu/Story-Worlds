The cobalt silver of Tuthru’s armour glinted in the sun as her command wagon slowly puffed its way down the cobbled road. She callously regarded the surrounding masses with the cold, expressionless steel glare of her helmet visor. Sitting back, she smirked to herself, this feeling of invulnerability was amazing, an entire town of infidels shocked into silence by nothing but the sight of a steam-powered vehicle and an overlarge combination of bare tits and cock intricately presented by her armour.

She wrapped her arm around Sonya who was sitting to her right, wearing her full ceremonial robes of purple silk and gold brocade, and Tanya to her left dressed in a white silken gown that loosely hugged her pristine curves and framed her immaculate bust. In Kaldaria their outfits would not have been considered unusually lewd, but in this heretical land, the sight of nudity, transgenderism, polygamy, homosexuality; each of these alone would be enough to draw the ire of most citizens, let alone all at once. Still, that’s why they were here after all, to liberate these people from such backwards ideas. In the meantime they would just have to watch on judgementally, or jealously, as Tuthru’s iron-ringed rod swelled a little in the grip of her concubines.

She let out a little yawn as the wagon idly drew to a stand at the bottom of a set of marble stairs to the town hall. Flanked by her guards on either side, her claws clinked as they hit the cold stone, followed shortly by the dull clang of her member’s armoured tip landing between them, easily long enough to drag along the floor. She made her way up the steps, followed closely by her high priestess on the right. As she reached the top, she was greeted by a collection of seven men who bowed nervously before the middle one stepped forward, presenting his hand to shake Tuthru’s. “A pleasure to finally meet you in person, your Elegance! I had hoped it would be under more congenial circumstances but...” he trailed off, his hand awkwardly sticking out in front of him as Tuthru stared contemptously at it. He gingerly retracted it. Tuthru remained totally silent with her hands behind her back, her plump gold tits proudly puffed out before her proving quite a distraction for the chairman. After a few seconds, Sonya spoke up “It is customary to give the tribute before negotiating with our goddess.” He grinned awkwardly

“Ahh, yes...right umm...the tribute! Uhh...b-bring out the...tribute I guess?” Tanya grinned smugly, folding her arms.

“What’s wrong chairman? Do our traditions disturb you in some way?”

“Ohh!! My! No! No, not at all, of course!” Hoping desperately for an end to the awkward encounter he turned around to hurry the arrival of a buxom wolf lady, quite clearly wearing too much make-up and draped in what appeared to be a potato sack. She hastily knelt down before the armoured goddess. Tuthru looked down at her...and then up at the chairman...and then across at Sonya who spoke again. The display earned a wave of boos from the crowd beneath them.

“What is this?”

“T-the tribute, High Priestess.”

Sonya regarded her for a good few seconds, “She’s barely even a B2 class. Who is she?”

“Why, she’s the finest prostitute we could find!”

Sonya shook her head “An unworthy sacrifice, you insult us with your ignorance! Look at our goddess’ cock! Barely even a twitch!” The chairman angled his head, flicking his eyes down at the wobbling mass he’d been avoiding since Tuthru had arrived, glancing at it no longer than necessary to verify that it was, indeed, unmoved. “I suggest you find a replacement before-heheh too late!”

Tuthru’s arm shot up, a single clawed finger of her gauntlet outstretched, pointing to one of the women standing behind the councilors. Her cold eyless glare fixated on the lithe blue fox who stood complacently before the council-house gates.

A moment of confusion passed between her and the chairman, before Sonya stepped in to clarify. “Hand her over. She is the tribute our goddess has chosen.”

“B-b-but you can’t!”

“Our goddess can do whatever pleases her.”

“But she’s my daughter!”

Sonya smirked “This is considered a suitable tribute.” As though ensnared by Tuthru’s gaze, the woman tentatively stepped forward. “I’ll do it, father. To ensure the safety of our people.” Unable to speak, he stood aghast as she took another step forward toward Tuthru. Once within arms reach the dragoness reached forward, grabbing the blouse of her tribute by the collar and tearing it open as she gasped in shock. She gently cupped a claw around the fox’s left tit and gave a gentle squeeze, her thick black cock steadily rising up from the floor, its veins bulging and filling out the cold iron rings of her cock-armour. The crowd broke out into an enraged uproar, but with a flick of her wrist Tuthru sent whistling magical sparks hurtling out behind her, detonating in colourful explosions above them, stunning them back into silence. “She is an acceptable tribute! I’ll take her.”

## Chapter 1:

Tuthru waved triumphantly, the steady pneumatic hiss of the passenger loading door steadily lifting her above the crowd as the crack that parted the inside from the outside of her private sky-yaucht-cum-mobile command station grew thinner and thinner. As it finally sealed shut, she took an audible sigh followed a moment later by Sonya who began promptly rubbing her eyes in exhaustion. Tanya’s professional facade shattered as she threw her arms around her still ironclad lover. Krystal stood awkwardly by the door, watching from afar.

Tuthru removed her helmet, gently easing off the heavy metallic structure, before throwing her head back and twisting her neck a few times. The cruel, indifferent pout of her helmet’s visor gave way to reveal the much more endearing, jovial expression beneath as she let out a moan of relief. She dumped it into Tanya’s arms, telling her to go put it away as she made her way over to a curtain archway that Sonya had passed under moments before. Nervously, Krystal trotted on behind into the next room.

The golden dragoness’ armour clinked as she dragged that heavy carapace across a large, warm and dimly lit room decorated by red and brown tapestries. The air hung heavy with a deep amber haze, each breath filling the lungs with a sweet spicy scent, somewhere between roses and cinnamon and illuminated by the deep flickering glow of lamplight. She strode over toward a huge cushioned armchair, almost the size of a bed and seemingly resembling a throne.

With a resigned sigh she collapsed back into the soft embrace of its cushions, smiling to herself as she gently wiggled in place to get herself comfy. She waved over a pair of wolves making out up the corner of the room, and calmly instructed them to start getting her armour off, which they did, delicately removing each peice. Starting with the breastplate, they unlocked the two metal hands cupping her soft and sizeable bust, letting her huge doughey breasts flop freely across her chest as the plates of forged steel were lifted gently away from her flesh.

Krystal stepped gingerly forward, biting her lip a little as she stood before Tuthru who regarded her with a confused gaze. “I...didn’t send for you yet did I?” Krystal looked shocked, worried she’d already broken some unsaid rule of this place. “Uhh! No! Sorry! Should I just...I wasn’t sure where to go.” Tuthru smiled cooly, gently stretching out her arms and legs as her bracers and greaves freed her figure. “It’s fine sweetie, I wanted to talk to you anyway. It’s just that most are usually feeling a bit...apprehensive by now.” Krystal giggled nervously before replying

“Ahahah, I’d be lying if I said I wasn’t a little nervous! You’re such a powerful woman afterall but...I don’t fear you or what you represent, like my father would have me do. I actually have a great deal of admiration for Kaldari culture and...and I’m excited to be part of it honestly.” With that off her chest, her ears pricked up happily as she raised her face to meet her mistress. “And uhh...on that note. All the women here are bare-chested and I kinda...mind if I take my top off?” At the mere suggestion, Tuthru’s cock gave a twitch of approval. Krystal’s nervous grin becoming steadily more confident as Tuthru smiled generously down at her. “Of course! People shouldn’t need permission to express their bodies however they wish. And unlike the backward culture you were born into we think boobs are pretty and should be celebrated, right girls?” To punctuate the point she gave her chest a little bounce, and kissed the chest of the wolf to her right who giggled happily and returned the gesture.

As the two wolves went down to start working on the mighty mass of cockflesh that graced the gap between their mistress’ thighs, Krystal eagerly peeled off her embroidered shift, leaving it discarded in the middle of the room. Tuthru patted the area beside her on the bed and held out her arm, an open gesture for Krystal to come join her which the fox accepted eagerly. “You know, you really should be careful about getting me hard before they get my armour off. It doesn’t come off easily then!” The wolves succeeded in freeing the delicate yet hefty black tip from within its casing, the armoured facade of a flared equine head giving way to the soft blunted shape of a semi-hard horsecock veiled behind a thick layer of foreskin, soft and pliable. Once the tip was off, each subsequent ring slid off easier than the last, a few drops of oil being used to slide each spiked section off of the veiny, ridged surface of that magnificent phallus. Finally, the breathaking majesty of Tuthru’s throbbing bare pride lay before them, glistening in the flickering lamplight.

Krystal struggled to keep her eyes off the glorious show, and Tuthru was not about to stop her jaw-dropped staring as the two of them chatted.
