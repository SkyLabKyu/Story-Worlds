# Physical Appearance

Deep space dragons are usually between 6' and 6'3 in height, primarily clad in hard dark-coloured scales that are smooth and shiny like obsidian. Unusually, for dragons, they have 3 horns made of sky ivory, which has a dull texture similar to frosted glass and is similarly translucent. They all appear to have the same, deep-grey eyes with a feint purple glow. As with many species, eye-colour is allegedly unique to each individual but this is not especially noticeable without the ability to perceive higher frequencies of light. As with many species of dragon the front of the torso as well as the inside of the legs, underside of the tail and other areas show a different pattern of scales. In the case of the deep space dragon this takes the form of a smooth leathery skin much softer than other areas of the body. This is visible as being a lighter colour than the scaled portions. Their wings are noticeable for being very thick and heavy, one side has a distinctive blue shimmer and the other is a dazzling reddish gold.  

Deep space dragons are sexually dimorphic with three biological sexes (female, male and alpha) both males and females have enormous sized penises which dwarf that of other species. Averaging at about 15 inches, anything less than 12 inches is considered 'short' and sizes up to 46 inches have been recorded. They also possess both internal and external testes which have evolved to be large and heavy due to being adapted to low gravity environments. This leads to very inflated libidos which, if not sated, can send them into a frenzied state in which they are unable to think clearly. Due to this fact, monogamy and fidelity are very alien concepts to most members of this species. Alphas are very similar to males, excepting that they are physically larger and have two peni which can be individually much larger even than those of the other two sexes. There are no recorded instances of deep space dragons with child-bearing capacity, instead they use the reproductive systems of other species to procreate (further details in reproduction section)
  
Females are usually highly intelligent and often act as leaders. Evolved for low-gravity environments their bodies often have a tall, curvaceous and elegant physique that is rarer in other species. As their species does not produce milk, their breasts have fully adapted to their secondary purpose as powerful prismatic capacitors. This gives them a firm yet bouncy appearance and texture and are larger and denser than those found in many other species. It also makes space dragon females unusually powerful magic users.

# Habitat Adaptations

Deep space dragons have (as the name suggests) evolved to survive in the harsh conditions of deep space. Their wings are primarily vestigial and produce much less lift even than those of other winged anthro species. Instead, they act as temperature regulators allowing them to shed waste heat, but also to absorb radiation from nearby stars to power their secondary respiration cycle, circumventing their need to breathe.  
  
Their blood is based on a compound of helium and mercury, allowing it to remain liquid at almost any pressure or temperature.  
Their scales and horns have adapted to survive comfortably at extremely high temperatures to protect against the extreme heating that occurs during atmospheric entry.  
  
They posses a set of glands positioned around their body, these use the naturally occurring Prisma from their souls to push around dark matter, allowing them to move freely in space.  
  
They are able to see a wide variety of wavelengths of light, from high infra-red all the way up to ultraviolet. They also have specially adapted receptors that allow them to perceive X-rays, this is responsible for the distinctive, deep-indigo fluorescence of their eyes.  
  
They posses a low muscle density, due to being adapted for low-gravity conditions. This often means they appear much stronger and heavier than they really are. Males and females usually weigh between 50-100kg fully grown, despite being naturally physically imposing. This fact is not true of alphas, which are balls of pure muscle and have been recorded weighing up to 1.2 metric tonnes (shortly before the equipment was destroyed by the subject attempting to cram almost 5ft of penis down the throat of an unfortunate research facility staff member).

# Mating Habits

Deep space dragons never stay in one place for long, instead they roam around between worlds and mate with whoever takes their fancy. In this way they can be seen as brood parasites, leaving behind many eggs to be raised by members of other species. This behavior is possible due to the unique qualities of their semen that allows them to reproduce with a female host of almost any species. They have unusually large sperm, even visible to the naked eye under some circumstances, the semen is also very viscous and voluminous, resembling rice pudding in its general texture. The sheer amount delivered typically causes a recipient's entire reproductive system to become totally flooded. The sperm can completely envelop egg cells which they come into contact with, replacing its genetic code completely, rather than merging with it as in a typical mating event. In rare cases, some of the original genetic material from the host survives this process, resulting either in a non-viable pregnancy, or rarer yet, in a viable hybrid creature that displays features of both the host species and the deep space dragon.
  
To increase their potential pool of mates, these dragons use their spaceflight abilities to travel between inhabited planets, covering vast regions as large as stellar clusters without the need for vehicles. Furthermore their penises are lined with thousands of microscopic hairs that, when they come into contact with another being, will break off and stick into them (see figure 1). Once buried deep into the recipient's flesh it will release a serum (peptostellulene) that massively increases sensitivity to pleasure stimuli by up to 100x. This effect lasts only for a few hours, however, before decomposing into a powerful anaesthetic (redactostellulene) that numbs the area and lasts up to several months. In some cases this means that having once felt a TK-1 penis, subjects are unable to obtain sexual gratification in any other way and can even become addicted to mating with them.  
  
To further improve their sexual appeal to all species, they secrete a constant layer of oil over their cocks to keep them pre-lubed and ready to fuck at a moment's notice. This oil has a fairly low specific heat of vapourization, allowing it to evaporate rather easily forming a visible steamy haze that rises from that delicious glistening slab of meat, as well as an intoxicating scent that makes it rather difficult to concentrate on writing professional scientific documentation. Furthermore their semen is described to have a sweet and creamy flavour, similar to that of butterscotch...can confirm, it's fucking delicious holy shit!

# Conclusion

I don't know what to put here...can't think straight. Subject 4 is looking at me and licking his lips, his cock is so big and hard, streaks of precum drooling down the glass of his enclosure. I'm leaving my boyfriend, I thought I knew what love was but I didn't. Love is what I feel right now, gazing at those twitching gurgling plums! I'm going to marry him, submit myself to him, become his breeding bitch and ruin my womb to birth more of his perfect species!
