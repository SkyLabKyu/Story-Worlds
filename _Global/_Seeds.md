It was a rainy Tuesday evening, Nerva sank into the soft cushions of the couch in her nerd-cave, putting her feet up on the coffee table and cracking open a cold can of Kola. Letting out a sigh of relief and frustration, she did her best to try and put the events of that day behind her, and relax with an evening of videogames. Taking a deep breath and a sip of her kola, she fired up her pc and begin idly skimming through the list of games. First she had a look through the RTS section, but those demanded her attention and she was far too tired to give it, which pretty much left her with a selection of simulator and management games. She opened her favorite city builder, pulling up a podcast and relaxed back on the couch fully expecting to spend the rest of the night alone, probably fall asleep on the sofa and wake up the following morning in time for work as usual. Such was the mechanically rhythmic life of an ‘autistic freak’ she thought to herself, huffing in frustration before once again trying to put it behind her and focus on her game…that was until she heard a knock at the door.

At first she sat bolt upright with a start, before cocking her head to one side curiously. As the door cracked open slowly, the pleasant scent of freshly baked pizza began to waft into the room. A red, glowing, sheepish expression peered around the door, an almost unheard of expression from the headstrong protogen who wore it. “Heyyyya Nerv~ I brought pizza!” Tsuzu said. Nerva gawked at her in surprise, raising an eyebrow “Didn’t think I was ‘worth your time’ anymore Tsu?” The protogen sighed, her face looking cresfallen as she gingerly stepped into the neon gloom of Nerva’s nerdcave. “Yeah I…look I’ve come to apologize…I fucked up, sometimes I say things without really…thinking…at all. I was pissed off at you, I was trying to hurt you and I’m really sorry for that, but I didn’t mean a word of it. I overreacted and…I regret that…a lot.” Gently she placed the pizza on the coffee table by Nerva’s feet. “So yeah…this is for you. I know it ain’t much but it’s the best I’ve got for now. If you want me to just go I’ll…I’ll let you play your game I guess.” Nerva’s jaw dropped a little, her expression softening as she was genuinely taken aback by the protogen’s apology. She paused her game and with a soft smile patted the spot beside her on the sofa. “Hey, Tsuzu…don’t worry about it. I get how it is, I wasn’t thinking straight either…it’s been a long day, I’m super tired and you just seem to have so much energy all the time! I just kinda lashed out…I wanted to apologize too but you said you didn’t wanna talk to me anymore soo…” Tsuzu took up the coyote’s offer to sit beside her, gently cuddling up to her and placing a finger on Nerva’s lips as her expression slowly returned to a more familiar, cheeky smile as a playful paw began idly wandering down the front of Nerva’s shorts. “Hey, don’t worry about it~ All is forgiven! For what it’s worth…you do kinda work a more stressful job than me, so if you want I can maybe release a little of that stress while you play your game if you want?”

Tsuzu’s wandering hand gently gripped the girthy base of Nerva’s member, causing it to pulsate and stiffen slightly in the protogen’s grip. A cheeky smirk crossed the goth’s face as she began to gently fellate Nerva’s drooling stiffy. Amidst moans of pleasure Nerva smiled back, “Thanks babe~ I’d like that a lot…if it’s not too much trouble.” Tsuzu began properly blowing and polishing Nerva’s cock, not enough to be distracting but just enough that there was a constant dull thrum of erotic bliss coursing through her loins. “No trouble at all, gorgeous!”

Hours passed like that, the two of them losing track of time as they enjoyed each other’s company. For once, Nerva felt almost like the one in charge, idly enjoying her games as the world’s hottest popstar and best platonic girlfriend one could wish for endlessly pleasured her aching spear. It was true that she needed to release some stress, and Tsuzu knew better than anyone else how to help her do that. Once she had had her fill of Tsuzu’s oral service, Nerva pulled her into a shuddering embrace, surrendering control back to the other. Tsuzu treated her partner to a delightful show of her huge round tits, pinning her down with a passionate smooch and as the pair gamed on into the night more and more clothes came off until the two found themselves spooned together in bed, eyes stinging from the harsh glow of screens in the darkness and tiredness consumed them both.

The following morning, Nerva was the first to awaken. Subconsciously grinding between Tsuzu’s plump round ass cheeks and gently clutching the protogen’s right boob. As she came to her senses she tried to stop herself but it just felt too good. She knew Tsuzu would hardly mind though. The trashy troubadour lay sprawled out in a fluffy black heap, casually wiggling back into Nerva’s grinds as she came to her senses. When consciousness finally greeted her she rolled over and smothered Nerva’s face in her tits before cuddling her partner close and enjoying the sunrise together.

Six women stood in a row before Tuthru's throne, bakers come to present their wares for Tuthru's approval. Each of them held an expertly crafted cake on a tray. Kasia stood to the empress' right hand side, and gestured toward them "I've brought another selection of bakers from your kitchen, my dear! As a reward for their excellent contributions, they have this opportunity to present their work to you in person." Centilla stood to her left, arms folded with disapproval. She said nothing but merely stared at Tuthru with expression like a small thundercloud was raging six inches above her head. Even though Tuthru could only see her out of the corner of her vision, she was well aware of the fox's demeanour and it only amused her all the more. Rising from her throne, she approached the awaiting bakers and carefully examined what they had brought for her. She inspected each one for the slightest flaw or imperfection, but even after several passes she could find none on any of them, the ladies really had gone above and beyond this time to ensure that what they had to offer was utterly impeccable. "As tradition dictates," Tuthru began to announce, "I'll begin by selecting the ugliest of the cakes!". Almost at random, she came to a stop in front of the forth from the left. Standing politely with her hands behind her back, Tuthru looked her in the eye and smiled. "Place it on the floor~" The baker's shoulders sagged, and her face fell into an expression of annoyance and dissappointment. She silently got down on one knee, placing her tray on the floor at Tuthru's feet, before taking a few steps back. Raising one foot into the air, she brought it down swiftly on the awaiting cake with a devious chuckle, its soft delectable texture feeling delightful as it squashed beneath her foot, light creamy filling squishing up between her toes. Her member proudly throbbed as she ground her heel into the slippery mess. Alessa placed one hand comfortingly on the back of the disgruntled baker, "Don't worry, your time will come! You'll prove you're worthy I know it!"
Centilla shook her head, thinking she was out of Tuthru's field of vision, but the dragoness had been keeping half an eye on her favorite prude. "Ohh~? You think I made the wrong decision Cuntilla? Well, if you're more all-knowing than a literal fucking deity why don't you decide which one gets fed to my lovely trash-panda!?" She punctuated the point by pulling Alessa close to her side and wrapping one arm around her shoulders, planting a wet sloppy smooch on the raccoon's face which left a sticky black lipstick mark on her cheek. Centilla rolled her eyes, teeth gritted with frustration as she tried in vain not to let the goddess get under her skin. "No...you know what I think, that it's a waste of good food and that it's disgusting!" With a smirk, Tuthru raised an eyebrow "Alessa...show her what disgusting looks like~" she pointed to another of the assembled cake-bearers and simply clicked her fingers, beckoning for her to come closer. As she did, Alessa took the tray and raised it up to the level of her chest, licking her lips hungrily. "With pleasure, my love~ I give this sacrifice to you, my goddess!" And with that she raised the cake up, tipping the tray so that it fell down onto her awaiting open-mouthed face. Cream and icing went everywhere with an audible squelch, the tray fell to the floor with an almighty clatter that echoed around the vast stone chamber. Alessa fell to her knees, letting out a moan of ecstasy as she smeared lumps of squashed cake all over her face and breasts, rubbing them in and covering herself in a thick creamy mess. She began to lick some of it off her face, moaning in pleasure as the vast majority was slathered over her body, clumps of soft sponge and jam sliding down between her boobs. The sight alone had Tuthru's cock rock hard and aching but Alessa had something else to give her mistress even more pleasure. Gripping Tuthru's huge round rump, she cupped and squeezed it with her cake-covered hands, spreading the godess' shapely cheeks wide enough to shove her snout into her lover's crack and passionately make out with the twitching black ring that lay within. Tuthru's knees trembled a little at the sensation of Alessa licking at her asshole, her face still covered in the soft remnants of delicious cake being squished up into her aching pucker, and hands covered in thick slop that began to stroke and massage her huge divine pillar of pleasure, making it into a similarly repulsive cakey mess.

Splotches of wet icing and chocolate mousse dripped down her legs and landed with wet splats amidst the rest of the mess still squelching around underfoot. Tuthru stood tall, hands crossed politely behind her back, legs slightly spread to let her 5th wife do her filthy work between them, and she looked at Centilla with a devious sneer. "If sacrifices to my glory are such a waste, then you're free to lick up the scraps babe~" Centilla's lip curled in disgust, she could feel vitriolic blasphemies rising up her throat, wanting nothing more than to spit them at the arrogant selfish slob, but she held her tongue and settled instead for merely clenching her jaw in anger.

While relaxing away from the midday warmth with a delicious fondue, Alessa became aware of the curvaceous silhouette of her wife drawing itself up to the threshold of her house and propping herself up against the doorway. Tuthru's gorgeous golden body was draped with jewels and she spoke with a deep refined voice, "Afternoon, my love! Mind if I join you for lunch?" Tuthru began to slowly cross the room toward the raccoon, the mischeivious smile and purposeful throb of her semi-erection indicating that she was here for more than just food. As the dragoness strode through the door, Alessa sat up with a smile on her face reaching out her arms toward her approaching lover. "Tuthru!! Of course you can join me dear~ You know I always love your unexpected visits!" The couple embraced on the couch, each letting out a soft moan as their lips locked, and they shared a deep passionate kiss. "Sooo? What you got cooking babe?" asked Tuthru as she picked up a mushroom from a bowl and dipped it into the bubbling pot of cheese in the middle of the table. "Ohh, just a basic cheese fondue. I wasn't expecting you around, or I'd have gotten something more interesting ready." She also picked up a mushroom, gazing at it for a moment before smirking impishly as she contemplated how similar its shape was to the much larger flare of the dragon's fat glistening flare. "Although...that should be a pretty interesting combination of flavours~" She playfully tossed the mushroom to one side and wrapped both hands around Tuthru's semi-hard shaft, staring at it with hungry eyes. As Tuthru swallowed her mouthful, her eyes widened in surprise as she felt her member firmly gripped, hefted upward, and dumped unceremoniously into the bowl of warm sticky bubbling cheese. The table shook under the weight of meat being dumped onto it, causing the bowl to tip over and spill its contents in a messy puddle which quickly started to cool and set. After the sudden shock of hot cheese on her sensitive tip, Tuthru let out a garbled moan of shock and pleasure. Fighting against the sticky mess on the table, her shaft stiffened to full mast, pulling itself away in a satisfying stringy display. Alessa started to lick the molten cheese off of Tuthru's cock, letting out a moan of genuine pleasure at the deep pungent flavour of her lover's cock covered in cheese, before wrapping her lips around the tip and sucking hard, making sure to taste every inch. "F-fuuck~! Alessa...don't stop~" Tuthru's dumbfounded face of pleasure returned to its normal devious grin as she gradually regained her composure, throwing her head back to enjoy her fifth wife's inelegant but deeply effective technique of making her very very happy indeed. Gripping Alessa by the hair, Tuthru forced her hard twitching horsecock deep into her throat and let out a deep moan of bliss as she began to unabashedly orgasm into her wife's face, the thick sticky ballspew gushing in fat dollops from Alessa's nose and mouth. Alessa gagged and spluttered, swallowing as much as she could while the remainder of the hot steamy mess drooled down between her tits. When the dragon was done she released her grip from Alessa's hair, and she reeled back gasping for air, giggling and coughing as she inhaled several thick strings of cum. "Holy fuck, Ru! Wasn't expecting such a generous blessing from you right away~" Tuthru rested her hands behind her head, grinning smugly as she squirted a few more strings over Kasia's face and tits. "Feels too good not to, my dear! Besides, you know what a burden I carry as the ever-virile goddess that I am, I'm always on a hair's trigger~" Tuthru happily pulled her wife close and squeezed her tight, gently feeling up her breasts with a happy moan. Alessa nestled her face into Tuthru's neck, "Still up for more, you insatiable beast~?" "Perhaps...but first I wanna get something to eat. I'm in the mood for doughnuts...think you can sort that for me sweetie?" "Of course, my dear! I'll need some help glazing them though~" The raccoon teasingly swirled a finger around the tip of Tuthru's cock, earning her a thick gooey spurt of precum.

The sound of synthesized moans echoed around the empty locker room, supplimented by the rhythmic creaking of the changing bench as Tsuzu clung tightly onto its steel frame the bolts holding it to the floor and keeping it attached to the wooden panelling slowly being wrenched free from their housing with each powerful thrust that rocked her body. With a mischeivious grin crossing her visor she turned to face Brutus, his hooves planted one on the floor and the other on the bench, very much enjoying the sensation of cramming himself into the protogen’s grotesquely tight cunt. With a grin so wide it looked like her face might crack, Tsuzu met his eye “C’mon big boy! You can tear a slut up better than this!! I thought horses were supposed to be good at giving it rough!!” With a snort of frustration, he tightly wrapped one hand around her neck, gripping her waist with the other arm and slamming her hard enough into the lockers to put a dent in them as he began pumping his log with much more speed and ferocity, the sight resembling a well-lubricated piston engine as Tsuzu’s excessive and slippery pussy-slop mixed with his precum, to form a thick stringy substance that stuck the two of them together like half-dried PVA as he withdrew before that fleshy member began bending just slightly to transmit the force of each thrust into her deepest depths. Each excessively energetic cycle being repeated relentlessly, brutally three or four times each second and Tsuzu was loving every second of it. “You want rough bitch!? You’d better be careful what you fucking wish for!! I’ll pound you to a pulp and use you as lube on my next bitch!” With his hand around her throat Tsuzu’s only reply was the pair of twinkling heart emojis that took the place of her eyes, and of course the relentless succession of shuddering squirting orgasms that wracked her body. Had she not been pinned so tightly to the cold metal of the lockers before her then her trembling legs would surely have given way beneath her and left her an elated whimpering mess on the floor. With a triumphant whinny, and an audible series of splurts, he began the long and arduous process of flooding her womb with around a litre and a half of warm gooey horse spunk, enough to completely top out her poor tight womanhood leaving her with messy splats all over her ass and dripping down the inside of her thighs. As his climax finally ended he released his grasp, panting as he stepped back. Tsuzu held onto the locker for support, her legs still weak from the impossible quantities of pleasure still coursing through her circuits.

Kyu’s hand flopped lazily down on their alarm clock as they stretched and let out a deep yawn. They flopped the sheets off of themself, letting a rush of cool morning air rush over their svelte and well-toned form. Instinctually they wrapped both arms around the fluffy feminine figure in the bed beside them and snuggled tight, swishing their tail. The coyote let out a shrill squeak as she was pulled toward the dragon, clutching onto Kyu for support before shaking her head in mild embarrassment and resting it gently on the dragon’s glistening bust. “Morning to you too Kyu…”

The dragon merely purred affectionately in response, still drowsy-eyed as they pulled the covers to one side and let their sweat-slickened pillar of morning wood air out with a happy sigh. “Morning Nerva~ You sleep well?”

Nerva scoffed, pulling her lustrous pink hair over her shoulder and looking contemptuously up at the dragon. “Relatively well…could do without being woken up to a flood of spunk in the middle of the night though~” Kyu lifted the sheets to see the sticky puddle of cock-batter that had indeed overtaken Nerva’s side of the bed, that they had no doubt pumped out at some point during a set of particularly pleasant dreams they’d had the night before. “Sorry sweetie~ Occupational hazard, I’m afraid heheh”

Nerva rolled her eyes, smirking as she shook her head. “If I had my way, you’d wear a condom every damn night, that way none of it would be wasted~” she smiled, trailing a finger around Kyu’s tip and deliberately teasing their aching spermpole.

“Condoms? Me? Blasphemy!” replied Kyu, flashing the yote a cheeky grin as they put their hands behind their head. Wiggling their hips and relaxing into Nerva’s gentle tease. A second, much firmer grip wrapped around the middle of their shaft before they felt several wet splats of saliva being unceremoniously splattered down their nuts and base of their cock. “Yeah~ Everyone knows the proper way to keep a dragon from blowing loads on a hair-trigger is to keep them well drained, babes!” Becky’s face appeared from between Kyu’s legs, her lips wrapping around their left nut and sucking hard as she wrapped her cute supple hand around the other and began stroking firmly up and down the dragon’s dick, smearing it with wet slop. The cheeky face of the squirrel looked up at what could only be described as her ‘personal challenge’ and fluttered her eyelashes, stroking firmly up and down the length of the stiff, sweat-dripping shaft of meat as she slapped the wobbling veiniy column repeatedly against her cheek. “I know even you can only bust a nut so many times in a day, and I WILL find out how many that is, even if it kills you~”

By now, Nerva had retracted her grease-covered fingertip from Kyu’s foreskin, blushing a little as she gazed down at the elite handjob from the red squirrel planted firmly between Kyu’s legs. She coyly pulled one hand to her face to hide her adorable beaming smile as she pulled herself close in to Kyu who returned the gesture, smiling as they planted a sticky black kiss on her cheek. Pulling Nerva close into their chest they went back to hanging their tongue out of their mouth in pleasure as their legs tightened, practically tying knots in the covers as they got ready to blow a fresh load for ‘nutty slutty’ who was now working her tongue up and down Kyu’s shaft. She savoured the robust meaty flavour of Kyu’s cock, slurping up every drop of the greasy secretions that seemed to ooze straight from the bulk of their meaty endowment

Seeing the way things were going, Nerva tried to clear out of the blast radius. “I’ve got work today!! I don’t wanna smell of dragon spunk yet!” Kyu clutched onto her, snuggling her tight as they pressed their bust into her back. “Sweetie, you’re already wearing a gallon of cockslop up your back, what’s a couple more litres up your front?” Nerva bit her lip, rolling over just in time to see Becky tease out an eruption from Kyu’s cock by pulling back their foreskin in one hand and sucking the cum straight out of their nuts with a powerful slurp on their tip before letting the mess fly high while licking the tip of their dick until every last rope had flown. The warm white fountain of sticky, salty spooge shot high up over the ladies’ heads before landing back on the bed, coating all of them in thick ropes of spunk.

“Ahh fuck, I’m gonna have to shower again now~” said Nerva after a minute or two. She rolled her eyes, “And no, you two can’t come with~ It’s going to need to be a quick one because I’ve gotta open up shop.”

Becky pressed her cum-covered bust firmly against the dragon’s as the pair admired Nerva’s shapely rump slowly fading behind the frosted glass door to Kyu’s room. Kyu smiled, holding her close, they’d blown two whole loads already today without having to get out of bed, or even touch their own dick. They gazed out onto the gorgeous seaside vista visible from the enormous picture window taking up the whole western wall of the room and gently stroked the soft and glossy fur down Becky’s delicious curvacious body.

With a pat and a squeeze of that bare rump, Kyu wrenched themself reluctantly out of bed, yawning and stretching their arms and wings. Strings of thick wet slop poured off their semi-hard cock and drooled down their nuts. “Ahh, I guess I should probably get up too sweetie~ You wanna join me for some breakfast?”

Becky grumbled softly, snuggling herself into the covers to make up for the cold, dragon-shaped hole beside her. “Ahh, I’d love to babes, but I got nowhere to be and I didn’t get much sleep tonight. Mind if I chill here for now? I’ll make it up to you later~” She shoved her tongue into her cheek, fluttering her eyelashes as she mimed giving a blowjob. Kyu appeared unfazed by the gesture, but couldn’t supress an obvious twitch of arousal from their fat sweaty dong. “Sure thing cutie. It’s not like anyone else is gonna be using my bed while I’m out! You better keep your ass covered up if you’re still here when I get back though, it’s so damn gorgeous I might not be able to help myself~” Kyu smirked, licking their lips as they began to gently pleasure themself, teasing forth some more sticky mess in the form of thick strings of precum dribbling from their tip.

They picked up their phone from the nightstand, idly scrolling through the Club Erotikana group chat. “Say sweetie~ Tsuzu’s having a beach party tonight, you wanna come with?

Becky looked up from snuggling into the covers, intrigued. “Oh, that sounds like fun! Yeah, I'm in. What time?” Kyu grinned, typing out a reply to the chat. “Just after sunset. I heard they're gonna have a bonfire and everything~” The squirrel giggled, her tail wagging eagerly. “Ooh, sounds like a real rager. Can't wait! Maybe I'll even get to show off my new bikini~” Kyu chuckled, putting down their phone and leaning over to plant a sticky kiss on the tip of Becky's nose. “I'm sure it'll look amazing on you, cutie. Have fun while I'm gone, okay?” With that, they got up and made their way to the shower, eager to wash off the layers of spunk and start their day.
